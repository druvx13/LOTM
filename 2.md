**Chapter 2: The Situation**

*Clack-clack-clack!*  
Zhou Mingrui stumbled backward several steps, as if the figure in the mirror weren’t himself—but a desiccated corpse.

*How could someone with such a grievous wound still be alive?*

Disbelieving, he turned his head again to inspect the other side. Even from farther away, in the dim, hazy light, the through-and-through wound and dark crimson bloodstains were unmistakable.

“This…”

He drew a slow breath, forcing himself to stay calm.  
Placing a hand over his left chest, he felt his heart pounding—fast, forceful, unmistakably alive.  
He brushed his fingers over exposed skin: beneath a faint chill flowed warmth.  
He squatted, tested his knees—yes, they still bent.  
Rising again, his panic began to subside.

“What’s going on?” he muttered, frowning. He decided to examine the head wound more carefully.

He took two steps forward—then halted.  
The crimson moonlight outside was too faint to allow proper inspection.

A memory fragment flashed involuntarily.  
Zhou Mingrui turned toward the wall beside the desk—the gray-white pipe and the metal-grilled gas lamp mounted upon it.

This was a standard gas lamp, common in this era: stable flame, excellent illumination.

Given Klein Moretti’s family circumstances, they shouldn’t even afford a kerosene lamp, let alone gas lighting. Candles would’ve been more fitting for their station. But four years ago, when Klein stayed up late studying for the Hoy University entrance exam—a moment his elder brother Benson deemed critical to the family’s future—Benson had insisted on creating better conditions, even if it meant borrowing money.

Of course, Benson wasn’t reckless. Literate and employed for years at an import-export firm, he was shrewd and pragmatic. He’d convinced their landlord to fund the basic gas-line installation by arguing it would “raise the apartment’s class and improve future rental value.” Then, leveraging his company connections, he acquired a brand-new gas lamp at near cost price. In the end, he’d paid entirely from savings—no debts incurred.

The memory flickered past.  
Zhou Mingrui returned to the desk, opened the gas valve, and turned the lamp’s ignition switch.

*Click-click-click…*  
The sparking mechanism sounded—but no light appeared, contrary to his expectation.

*Click-click-click!* He tried again. Still darkness.

“Hmph…”  
Withdrawing his hand and pressing his left temple, he scoured his borrowed memories for an explanation.

Seconds later, he turned and walked toward the front door—stopping before a wall-mounted mechanical device connected to the same gray-white piping.

A gas meter.

Glancing at the exposed gears and bearings, he pulled a coin from his trouser pocket.

It was dull yellow, gleaming faintly with copper. On the obverse: the crowned profile of a king. On the reverse: a “1” encircled by wheat sheaves.

Zhou Mingrui recognized it: the copper penny, the Loen Kingdom’s basic currency. One penny had roughly the purchasing power of three or four yuan back in his world. Denominations also included 5-penny, half-penny, and quarter-penny coins—but even then, everyday transactions still often required rounding up.

After flipping the coin—minted only upon King George III’s coronation—a few times between his fingers, he slid it into the gas meter’s narrow, vertical slot.

*Clatter-clink!*  
As the penny dropped into place, the internal gears whirred to life—*click-clack-click*—producing a brief, almost musical mechanical chime.

Zhou Mingrui waited a few seconds, then returned to the desk and twisted the gas lamp switch once more.

*Click-click-click—pop!*  
A flame sparked to life, quickly swelling. Bright light filled the lamp’s glass chamber, then spilled outward, bathing the room in a warm, golden glow.

Darkness receded instantly. The crimson hue vanished from the window.  
Feeling inexplicably more at ease, Zhou Mingrui hurried back to the mirror.

This time, he examined the wound at his temple meticulously—missing no detail.

After close comparison, he realized: apart from the initial bloodstains, the grotesque wound wasn’t oozing anymore, as if expertly cauterized and bandaged. More astonishingly, the grayish-white brain tissue within was subtly pulsing, and the flesh around the injury was visibly knitting itself back together. At this rate, the wound might fully heal within thirty to forty minutes—or perhaps a couple of hours—leaving only a faint scar.

“A healing perk from transmigration?” Zhou Mingrui quirked the corner of his right lip, whispering soundlessly.

Then he exhaled deeply. Regardless of the cause—he was still alive!

Composed now, he pulled open a drawer, retrieved a small bar of soap, took a threadbare towel hanging beside the cabinet, opened the door, and headed toward the shared second-floor washroom.

*Gotta wash off this blood. Don’t want to look like a crime scene. Scaring myself is fine—but if I frighten little Melissa tomorrow morning, things’ll get messy!*

The corridor outside was pitch-black, save for the faint crimson moonlight from the far-end window—just enough to outline protruding objects, making them resemble pairs of monstrous eyes silently watching the living from the depths of night.

Treading lightly and more than a little unnerved, Zhou Mingrui made his way to the washroom.

Inside, the moonlight was stronger—everything came into clearer view. He stood before the sink and turned the tap.

*Gurgle-gurgle…*  
The sound of running water triggered another memory: Mr. Frenchie, their landlord.

Since water was included in rent, this short, wiry man—always clad in a top hat, waistcoat, and black formal coat—made it his mission to patrol the washrooms, eavesdropping on water flow.  
If he heard excessive splashing, he’d abandon all pretense of gentlemanly decorum, brandishing his cane and pounding on the door while shouting:  
“Damn thief!”  
“Waste is shameful!”  
“I’ve got your number!”  
“One more time, and you’ll pack your filthy bags and get out!”  
“Believe me—this is the best deal in all of Tingen! You won’t find a more generous landlord!”

Shaking off the thought, Zhou Mingrui soaked the towel and began scrubbing the dried blood from his face—again and again.

After checking his reflection in the washroom’s cracked, grimy mirror and confirming only the raw wound and pallid complexion remained, he felt significantly lighter. He then stripped off his linen shirt and used the soap to scrub away the blood spatters.

Just then, his brow furrowed—he realized another problem loomed:

*With such a dramatic wound and so much blood… there must be traces beyond my body—inside the room too!*

Minutes later, having rinsed his shirt, Zhou Mingrui returned home with the damp towel. First, he wiped the bloody handprint from the desk. Then, under the gas lamp’s glow, he searched for other remnants.

He quickly found spattered droplets on the floor and underside of the desk—and, by the left wall, a gleaming brass bullet casing.

“…He pressed the revolver to his temple and pulled the trigger?”  
The pieces clicked into place. Zhou Mingrui now had a rough idea of Klein’s cause of death.

But he didn’t dwell on it yet. First, he thoroughly cleaned every trace of blood—meticulously erasing the “scene.” Only then did he pick up the bullet casing, return to the desk, swing open the revolver’s cylinder to the left, and dumped out its contents.

*Clack-clack-clack.*  
Five bullets and one empty shell—each gleaming with that same warm brass luster.

“As I thought…”  
He glanced at the spent casing, then carefully reloaded each round into the cylinder, nodding faintly.

His eyes drifted left—to the open notebook, to the sentence inscribed in Hermes Script:  
**“All men die. Including me.”**

New questions surged:

*Where did the gun come from?*  
*Was this suicide—or staged to look like one?*  
*What kind of trouble could a common history graduate possibly get into?*  
*And why is there so little blood for a self-inflicted gunshot? Did my transmigration interrupt death itself—and trigger automatic healing?*

After a moment’s contemplation, Zhou Mingrui changed into another linen shirt, sat down, and turned his mind to a far more urgent matter.

Klein’s fate wasn’t his priority right now.  
The real question was: *Why did I transmigrate—and can I go back?*

His parents. Relatives. Best friends. The vibrant online world. All those foods he loved…  
Just thinking of them filled him with desperate longing.

*Click… click… click…*  
His right hand unconsciously spun the revolver’s cylinder open and shut—over and over.

“Nothing’s been particularly different lately… just unusually unlucky. How did I end up transmigrating out of nowhere?”

*Unlucky…*  
Suddenly—like lightning splitting a fog—another memory flashed.

*Right! Before dinner tonight, I performed a luck-changing ritual!*

As a self-proclaimed “keyboard expert” in politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore—someone who prided himself on “knowing a little about everything” (though his friends mocked him as “knowing just enough to be dangerous”)—he’d dabbled in esoteric arts too.

Last year, back in his hometown, he’d bought a vertically printed, thread-bound old book titled *Secret Fangshu Techniques from Qin and Han Dynasties* from a secondhand stall. Thought it’d be fun for online posturing. But ancient vertical script was hard to read, and his interest faded fast—he’d flipped through only the first few pages before tossing it into a corner.

Then, over the past month—after losing his phone, clients vanishing, work blunders piling up—he’d randomly recalled that the book’s opening chapter described a luck-changing ritual. Simple. No prerequisites.

Figuring it couldn’t hurt, he’d dug up the book and performed the rite before dinner.

Nothing happened.

…Until midnight, when he woke up here.

*Transmigrated!*

“There’s a real chance… that ritual caused this,” Zhou Mingrui murmured, abruptly sitting bolt upright, halting the revolver’s idle spinning.  
“If it really was the trigger, then maybe—just maybe—I can reverse it tomorrow!”

No matter what—he had to try.  
Even a dead horse was worth treating as if it might live.

*P.S.: Three updates tomorrow—making up for a missed chapter from my last book (manually inserting clown emoji here). First at midnight, second at 12:30 PM, third at 7:00 PM.*
