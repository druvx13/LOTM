**Chapter 1: Crimson**

Pain!  
So much pain!  
My head—aching like hell!

The kaleidoscopic dreamscape, teeming with hushed whispers, shattered instantly. Zhou Mingrui, still deep in sleep, felt an excruciating stab in his skull—as if someone had swung a club at it, no, worse: as if a sharp object had pierced his temple and was now twisting inside.

*Ugh…*  
Half-conscious, he tried to roll over, to clutch his head, to sit up—but his limbs wouldn’t obey. His body had gone numb, beyond his control.

*Guess I’m not truly awake yet… still dreaming…*  
He’d experienced false awakenings before—moments when you think you’ve woken, only to realize you’re still trapped in slumber. Familiar with such disorientation, Zhou Mingrui strained to focus his will, desperate to break free from this haze of darkness and delirium.

Yet in that liminal state between sleep and wakefulness, his thoughts drifted like smoke—elusive, scattered. No matter how hard he tried, his mind kept wandering, spawning chaotic, intrusive thoughts.

*Why the sudden headache? In the middle of the night, no less?*  
*And why so intense?*  
*Could it be a brain hemorrhage or something?*  
*Damn… am I seriously going to die young?*  
*Wake up! Wake up now!*

*Hmm… the pain’s easing a bit. Still feels like a dull blade sawing slowly through my brain, though…*  
*No way I can sleep anymore. How am I supposed to go to work tomorrow?*  
*Wait—why even think about work? With a legit migraine like this, I’ll just call in sick. Let Manager Luo rant all he wants!*  
*Actually… that doesn’t sound half bad. Heh. Steal a half-day of leisure from this floating life…*

Wave after wave of throbbing pain gradually coalesced into a fragile, almost illusory strength. With one final surge of effort, Zhou Mingrui arched his back and flung open his eyes—yanking himself fully out of that half-asleep limbo.

At first, his vision blurred—then slowly tinted with a faint crimson hue. Before him stood a desk of untreated wood, its surface centered on an open notebook. The paper was coarse and yellowed, and at the top of the page, a sentence was written in strange, alien script—deep black ink, vivid as if about to bleed.

To the left edge of the notebook sat a neat stack of books—seven or eight volumes. On the wall beside them ran a gray-white pipe, feeding into a wall-mounted lamp of Western classical design: roughly half the size of an adult’s head, with a transparent glass interior framed by black metal grilles.

Beneath the extinguished lamp, bathed in soft crimson light, rested a black inkwell. Its surface bore faint relief carvings—an indistinct angelic figure barely visible through the glow.

Just before the inkwell, on the right side of the notebook, lay a stout, dark-hued fountain pen, its nib glinting faintly. Beside it, its cap set aside, was a revolver with a warm brass gleam.

*A revolver?*  
Zhou Mingrui froze. Everything before his eyes was utterly unfamiliar—nothing like his own room.

Even as bewilderment seized him, he noticed that the desk, the notebook, the inkwell, and the revolver were all veiled in a translucent crimson "gauze"—moonlight pouring in through the window.

Instinctively, he lifted his head, his gaze drifting upward.

There, against a backdrop of black velvet night sky, hung a full moon—crimson-red, luminous, serene.

*What…?*  
Panic surged through him. He shot upright—but before his legs could fully straighten, another sharp stab of pain lanced through his skull. His strength vanished in an instant; his center of gravity collapsed, and his backside slammed hard onto the wooden chair.

*Thud!*

The pain didn’t slow him. Gripping the desk, he pushed himself up again, whirled around, and frantically scanned his surroundings.

The room was small. Two brown doors stood on the left and right walls. Against the far wall sat a wooden bunk bed. Between it and the left door stood a cabinet—double-doored above, five drawers below.

At about eye level along the cabinet’s edge, another gray-white pipe was embedded in the wall—but this one fed into a strange mechanical contraption, its gears and bearings partially exposed.

Near the right corner by the desk sat what looked like a coal stove, alongside pots and kitchenware—stockpots, frying pans, the like.

Beyond the right door stood a full-length mirror, its wooden base carved with simple, unadorned patterns—two faint cracks marred its surface.

At a glance, Zhou Mingrui caught a hazy glimpse of his own reflection:

Black hair. Hazel eyes. A linen shirt. Slender build. Unremarkable features, yet with sharp, defined bone structure…

He sucked in a sharp breath, his mind drowning in helpless, chaotic theories.

The revolver. The Western classical decor. That crimson moon—nothing like Earth’s.

*Could it be…?* His mouth slowly gaped open. *Have I… transmigrated?*

He’d grown up reading web novels—daydreamed about this very scenario countless times. Yet now that it was happening, he found himself utterly unprepared.

*Isn’t this exactly what they mean by “Ye Gong loved dragons—until he met a real one”…?* he mused bitterly, trying to laugh through the dread.

If not for the persistent, sharp pain in his head—keeping his mind taut and lucid—he’d have sworn this was just another dream.

*Calm down. Breathe. Stay calm…*  
He took several deep breaths, fighting to steady his racing heart.

Then, as his body and mind began to settle, fragmented memories suddenly surfaced—slowly unfolding in his consciousness.

*Klein Moretti. Native of Tingen City, Ahova Prefecture, Loen Kingdom, Northern Continent. Recent graduate of the History Department at Hoy University…*  
*His father, a Royal Army sergeant, died in a colonial conflict in the Southern Continent. The pension from his sacrifice enabled Klein to attend a private grammar school—the foundation that eventually led him to university…*  
*His mother, a devotee of the Goddess of the Night, passed away the very year he qualified for Hoy University…*  
*He had an older brother and a younger sister. They all shared a two-room apartment…*  
*The family was far from wealthy—if anything, they were struggling. His brother, a clerk at an import-export firm, was their sole breadwinner…*  
*As a history graduate, Klein had mastered Ancient Fusak—the linguistic root of Northern Continent tongues—as well as Hermes Script, commonly found in ancient tombs and used in rituals and prayers…*

*Hermes Script?*  
Zhou Mingrui’s heart skipped. Pressing a hand to his throbbing temple, he turned back to the open notebook on the desk. The strange letters on its yellowed pages shifted—first alien, then unfamiliar, then oddly familiar—until, suddenly, they became legible.

It was written in Hermes Script.

The inky-black words declared, stark and dripping:

**“All men die. Including me.”**

*Gah!*  
A primal terror gripped him. He instinctively recoiled, trying to put distance between himself and the notebook, between himself and those words.

Weak as he was, he almost toppled backward—only catching himself by slamming a hand onto the desk’s edge. The air around him seemed to stir; faint, whispering voices brushed against his ears, evoking the same dread he’d felt as a child listening to elders tell ghost stories.

He shook his head. It was just a hallucination.  
Regaining his balance, he tore his eyes away from the notebook and gasped for breath.

His gaze then fell upon the brass-gleaming revolver—and a question struck him like lightning:

*“With Klein’s family’s financial situation… how could he possibly afford a gun—let alone have access to one?”*  
Zhou Mingrui frowned, deep in thought.

Then, something caught his eye.  
Along the edge of the desk—half a crimson handprint, darker than the moonlight, denser than the gauzy glow.

*A bloodstain!*

“Blood…?”  
He flipped over the hand he’d used to steady himself—and stared. His palm and fingers were smeared with blood.

Meanwhile, the throbbing in his head persisted—slightly dulled now, but unrelenting.

*Did I crack my skull open?*  
Still speculating, he turned and walked toward the cracked mirror.

After a few steps, his reflection came into clearer focus:  
Medium height. Black hair. Hazel eyes. An unmistakable scholarly air.

*So this… is me now? Klein Moretti?*

He stood stunned. The dim light made details hard to discern, so he stepped closer—until he was just a hand’s breadth from the glass.

Bathed in the gauzy crimson moonlight, he tilted his head to inspect his temple.

The mirror showed him the truth:  
A ghastly wound gaped at his temple—its edges charred, surrounded by dried blood.
