**Chapter 4: Divination**  
*(Second Update — Please Vote for Recommendations!)*

Returning to his chair, Zhou Mingrui waited until the distant church bells tolled again—seven deep, resonant chimes—before slowly rising and heading to the cabinet for clothes.

Black waistcoat. Matching formal jacket. Trousers slightly tight at the ankles. A half-height top hat. The faint scholarly air these garments conveyed made Zhou Mingrui feel like he was staring into a Victorian-era British drama.

*“I’m not going to an interview—I’m just shopping for ingredients for the ritual,”* he muttered, shaking his head with a wry smile.

Klein had been so anxious about the upcoming interview that it had become bodily instinct. When Zhou Mingrui’s attention lapsed, he’d unconsciously reached for this one set of formal wear.

Heaving a sigh, he shed the jacket and waistcoat, donning instead a brown, weathered coat and replacing the top hat with a matching felt cap.

After tidying himself, he strolled to the bunk bed, lifted the top mattress, and reached through a barely noticeable tear at its base. After some fumbling, he located a hidden compartment.

When his right hand withdrew, it held a roll of bills—about seven or eight notes, greenish-white in hue.

This was all the money Benson had left—his entire savings, even including the next three days’ living expenses. Two five-Soler notes, the rest all one-Soler bills.

In Loen’s monetary system, the Soler ranked second-tier—originating from ancient silver coins. One Soler equaled twelve copper pennies, with denominations of one and five.

At the top stood the gold pound, also paper currency—but backed by gold and directly pegged to it. One gold pound equaled twenty Solers, in denominations of one, five, and ten.

Zhou Mingrui unfurled the bills, catching a faint, distinctive scent of special ink.

The smell of money.

Perhaps due to Klein’s memory fragments, perhaps due to his own unchanged desire for wealth—this instant, Zhou Mingrui felt he’d fallen in love with these little beauties.

*Look how exquisite the patterns are—making even the stern, mustachioed George III seem charming…*  
*Look how the watermark glows in sunlight—those carefully designed anti-counterfeiting seals set it apart from cheap imitations!*

After admiring them for several seconds, Zhou Mingrui extracted two one-Soler bills, re-rolled the rest, and tucked them back into the mattress compartment.

He smoothed the fabric near the tear, then folded the two bills neatly and placed them in the left pocket of his brown coat—separate from the few pennies in his trouser pocket.

Having done this, he slipped the key into his right pocket, grabbed a dark brown paper bag, and hurried toward the door.

*Clack-clack, clack…* The footsteps gradually slowed, then stopped.

Zhou Mingrui stood by the door, his brow furrowed without his notice.

Klein’s suicide was riddled with mysteries. If he went out like this, might he encounter some “accident”?

After a moment’s thought, he returned to the desk, opened the drawer, and pulled out the brass-gleaming revolver.

It was the only defensive weapon he could think of—and a powerful one at that!

Though he’d never practiced shooting, just pulling it out would surely intimidate people!

After caressing the cold metal cylinder, Zhou Mingrui slipped the gun into the same pocket as the bills. He clutched the money in his palm, fingers firmly pressing the grip—perfectly concealed.

A sense of security washed over him. But then, the “know-it-all” in him suddenly worried:

*“What if it misfires?”*

Idea following idea, Zhou Mingrui quickly found a solution. He drew the gun, spun the cylinder left, rotating the empty chamber—left by the “suicide”—to the firing position, then snapped it shut.

Now, even if it discharged accidentally, it’d be just an “empty shot”!

Slipping the gun back in place, his left hand remained in the pocket, not drawing it out again.

He pressed his hat with his right hand, opened the door, and strode out with a *thud*.

The corridor remained dim even in daylight—only limited sunlight filtered through the far-end window. Zhou Mingrui hurried down the stairs, out of the apartment, before he could truly feel the brightness and warmth.

Though mid-July—peak summer—the climate of Tingen, in northern Loen, was distinct. The highest annual temperature rarely exceeded 30°C (Earth’s scale), and mornings were refreshingly cool. Still, the streets had areas where dirty water pooled and trash littered the ground. In Klein’s memory, such scenes were common in low-income areas—despite having sewers—simply due to population density and living conditions.

“Come, come! Fresh, hot pan-fried fish!”  
“A steaming, fresh oyster soup—drink a bowl in the morning, and you’ll feel energetic all day!”  
“Fresh fish from the port—just 5 pennies a piece!”  
“Pancakes, eel soup with ginger beer!”  
“Conch! Conch! Conch!”  
“Fresh vegetables from the farms outside the city—cheap and fresh!”

Street vendors selling produce, fruit, and cooked food loudly hawked their wares to the hurried passersby. Some stopped to carefully compare and buy; others waved them off impatiently—jobs still uncertain.

Breathing air that alternated between stench and fragrance, Zhou Mingrui kept his left hand firmly gripping the gun’s handle, clutching the bills, while his right hand pressed his round-brimmed felt hat. He bent slightly, head lowered, threading through the bustling streets.

Where there were crowds, there were thieves—especially in this district, where many semi-unemployed workers and hungry children were employed by others.

As the crowd density gradually normalized, Zhou Mingrui straightened his back, lifted his head, and gazed at the street.

There, a wandering accordion player performed—a melody now soaring, now passionate.

Beside him gathered a crowd of ragged children, their faces sallow and waxen from malnutrition.

They listened to the music, followed the rhythm, swaying their bodies and dancing their own invented steps—faces beaming with joy, as if they were little princes, little angels.

A woman with a numb expression passed by—her skirt soiled, her skin dull.

Her eyes were blank and lifeless, only flickering with a faint light when she glanced at the children—as if seeing herself thirty years ago.

Zhou Mingrui passed her, turned onto another street, and stopped before “Slein’s Bakery.”

The owner was a seventy-something grandmother named Wendy Slein—her hair now fully gray, her face always wreathed in a gentle smile. Since Klein’s earliest memories, she’d been selling bread and pastries here.

*Her homemade Tingen cakes and lemon cakes were delicious…* Zhou Mingrui swallowed, smiling. “Mrs. Slein, eight pounds of rye bread.”

“Oh, little Klein! Where’s Benson? Still not back?” Wendy asked with a beaming smile.

“A few more days,” Zhou Mingrui replied vaguely.

As she selected the rye bread, Wendy sighed.

“What a hardworking, good boy. He’ll make a fine husband.”

She paused, grinning mischievously. “Now that you’re graduated—our Hoy University history graduate~ You’ll be earning money soon. You shouldn’t live in such an apartment—need at least your own washroom.”

“Mrs. Slein, you’re acting like a young, lively lady today,” Zhou Mingrui could only laugh awkwardly.

If Klein passed the interview and became a lecturer at Tingen University, the whole family would leap into the middle class!

In his memory fragments, he’d even fantasized about renting a suburban detached house: upstairs, five or six rooms, two washrooms, a large balcony; downstairs, two rooms, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, a washroom, a basement storage room.

Not a pipe dream. Even trainee lecturers at Tingen University earned 2 gold pounds weekly; after confirmation, it rose to 3 pounds, 10 Solers. By comparison, Benson—working for years—only made 1 pound, 10 Solers weekly. Factory workers made less than 1 pound, or just barely over. Such a detached house cost between 19 Solers and 1 pound, 18 Solers monthly.

*The difference between earning 3,000–4,000 and 14,000–15,000 a month…* Zhou Mingrui murmured inwardly.

Yet all this hinged on passing the interviews at Tingen or Backlund Universities.

As for other paths, without connections, he couldn’t get recommendations for civil service jobs. And with a history degree, employment options were narrow—private advisors to nobles, bankers, or industrial magnates weren’t in high demand.

Given that Klein’s knowledge had become “fragments”—incomplete, with many gaps—Zhou Mingrui felt embarrassed and anxious about Mrs. Slein’s expectations.

“No, I’ve always been this young,” Wendy replied with humor.

As she spoke, she placed the sixteen half-pound loaves—weight inevitably varied—into Zhou Mingrui’s brown paper bag and spread her right hand. “Nine pennies.”

“Nine? Isn’t it eleven?” Zhou Mingrui asked automatically.

It had been fifteen just a month ago.

“You can thank the repeal of the *Corn Laws*, and those who marched,” Wendy said, spreading her hands in laughter.

Zhou Mingrui nodded vaguely. Klein’s memory was fragmented here—only that the *Corn Laws*’ core was protecting domestic agricultural prices, preventing imports from southern nations like Fenet, Mathis, and Lumburg until prices rose to a certain point.

Why would people march to oppose it?

He said no more, afraid of revealing the revolver. Carefully, he extracted one bill and handed it to Mrs. Slein.

After receiving three copper pennies in change, tucked into his trouser pocket, he lifted the bread-filled bag and headed to the “Lettuce and Meat” market one street over—striving to fulfill his sister’s request for tender pea stew with lamb.

At the intersection of Iron Cross Street and Daffodil Street stood a municipal square, now filled with tents. Oddly dressed clowns were handing out leaflets.

“A circus performance tomorrow night?” Zhou Mingrui glanced at a flyer someone held, murmuring the content.

*Melissa would love that. Wonder how much the tickets cost?* The thought struck him, and he approached.

Just as he was about to ask one of the red-and-yellow clowns, a husky female voice suddenly came from his side:

“Want a divination?”

He turned instinctively. Before a low tent stood a woman in a pointed hat, wearing a black long dress.

Her face was painted with red and yellow greasepaint, her eyes a deep, gray-blue.

“No,” Zhou Mingrui shook his head. He didn’t have spare money for divination.

The woman smiled. “My Tarot readings are very accurate.”

“Tarot…” Zhou Mingrui froze.

That pronunciation was very similar to Earth’s Tarot cards!

And Earth’s Tarot belonged to a type of fortune-telling deck—just with more symbol-laden “picture cards.”

Wait… he suddenly recalled the origin of Tarot divination here.

It didn’t stem from the seven orthodox deities, nor ancient tradition—but was invented 170+ years ago by Roselle Gustave, then-ruler of the Republic of Indes.

This Mr. Roselle had invented the steam engine, improved sailing ships, overthrown the Kingdom of Indes, gained recognition from the Church of the God of Craftsmanship, and became the new republic’s first ruler.

Later, he conquered the south, bringing nations like Lumburg under protection, forcing Loen, Fenet, and the Vosak Empire to bow. Then he changed the republic to an empire, crowning himself “Emperor Caesar.”

It was during Roselle’s reign that the Church of the God of Craftsmanship received its first public divine decree since the Fifth Age—changing “God of Craftsmanship” to “God of Steam and Machinery.”

Roselle also invented Tarot divination, establishing the current deck composition and gameplay. This included types Zhou Mingrui recognized: *Upgrade*, *Fight the Landlord*, *Texas Hold’em*, *Gwent*…

Moreover, he’d dispatched fleets to find a route to the Southern Continent through storms and currents—ushering in the colonial age.

Unfortunately, in old age, he was betrayed. In Year 1198 of the Fifth Age, he was assassinated by the combined forces of the Church of the Ever-Burning Sun, the former royal family of Indes (House Sorlen), and other nobles—falling at White Maple Palace.

This… remembering these facts, Zhou Mingrui suddenly felt a toothache.

Could this guy have been a transmigrator too?

Thinking this, he became eager to see what Tarot cards looked like here. He nodded to the pointed-hat, greasepaint-wearing woman.

“If, uh, the price is reasonable, I’ll try.”

The woman immediately grinned. “Sir, you’re the first to come for a reading today. Free of charge.”
