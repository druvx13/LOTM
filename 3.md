**Chapter 3: Melissa**  
*(First Update — Please Vote for Recommendations!)*

With a plan in place, Zhou Mingrui finally felt grounded. His fear, restlessness, and anxiety all shrank into the shadows of his mind.

Only now did he have the presence to carefully sift through the remaining fragments of Klein’s memories.

Out of habit, he stood, turned off the gas valve, and watched the wall lamp slowly dim until it flickered out. He sat back down, unconsciously tracing the brass cylinder of the revolver with his fingers, pressing his temple as he quietly “relived” the memories in the crimson-tinged dark—like the most attentive audience member in a silent cinema.

Perhaps due to the bullet’s passage, Klein’s memories were like shattered glass—disjointed, with glaring gaps. Where had the finely crafted revolver come from? Was it suicide or murder? What did the line in the notebook—*“All men die. Including me.”*—really mean? Had anything strange happened in the two days before his death?

Not only were specific recollections fragmented—so too was Klein’s knowledge. In his current state, Zhou Mingrui doubted Klein could even graduate if he returned to university tomorrow, despite having left campus just days ago and never slacking off.

*“Two days from now… I have an interview with Tingen University’s History Department…”*  
*“Loen Kingdom universities don’t typically retain graduates directly… My advisor gave me recommendation letters—one for Tingen, one for Backlund…”*

As Zhou Mingrui silently “watched” these memories unfold, the crimson moon outside tilted westward, sinking lower and lower—until the east glowed faintly gold, dawn gilding the horizon.

Just then, a sound came from the inner room. Footsteps approached the partition door.

*“Melissa’s awake… She’s as punctual as ever.”*  
A faint smile touched Zhou Mingrui’s lips. Influenced by Klein’s memories, he already felt toward Melissa as if she were his own younger sister.

*…Though I never had a sister,* he immediately quipped inwardly.

Unlike Klein and his elder brother Benson, Melissa hadn’t received her early education at the Church of the Goddess of the Night’s Sunday School. By the time she reached school age, the Loen Kingdom had passed the *Elementary Education Act*, establishing a Central Board of Primary and Secondary Education and allocating special funding to expand public schooling.

Within three years—largely by absorbing existing church-run schools—the state had rolled out numerous public elementary schools, all strictly adhering to religious neutrality, carefully avoiding entanglement in doctrinal disputes among the Church of the Lord of Storms, the Church of the Goddess of the Night, and the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.

Compared to Sunday School—which cost just one copper penny per week but met only on Sundays—the public elementary schools’ fee of three pennies per week seemed steep. But with six full days of instruction weekly, the effective cost was nearly free.

Unlike most girls, Melissa had been fascinated since childhood by gears, springs, and bearings—and dreamed of becoming a steam mechanic.

Having personally suffered from lack of education, Benson understood its value as deeply as he’d supported Klein’s university dreams. Fortunately, Tingen Technical School counted as secondary education, so Melissa didn’t need the preparatory path of grammar schools or public schools.

In July of last year, at age fifteen, Melissa passed the entrance exam and joyfully enrolled in the Steam and Machinery Department at Tingen Technical School—raising her weekly tuition to nine pennies.

Meanwhile, Benson’s import-export company had been hit hard by turmoil in the Southern Continent. Profits and business volume had plummeted, forcing layoffs of over a third of staff. To keep his job and support the family, Benson accepted heavier workloads—frequent overtime, grueling business trips to harsh regions—just like these past few days.

Klein had wanted to help ease his brother’s burden—but as a commoner who’d clawed his way into university from an ordinary grammar school, he’d immediately felt the chasm between himself and wealthier peers. Take Ancient Fusak, the linguistic root of all Northern Continent nations: noble and affluent children studied it from childhood, while Klein only encountered it upon entering university.

There were countless such gaps. Klein had pushed himself to the limit—staying up late, rising early—just to barely keep pace, eventually graduating with merely average marks.

These memories of his siblings flickered through Zhou Mingrui’s mind—until the doorknob turned, the inner door creaked open, and he jolted back to reality.

*Wait—I’m holding a revolver!*  
*This is a semi-restricted weapon!*  
*It’ll terrify a kid!*  
*And my head wound—!*

Spotting Melissa about to emerge, Zhou Mingrui panicked. He pressed his temple—relieved to find the wound fully healed—then yanked open the desk drawer and shoved the revolver inside. It landed with a loud *thud*.

“What was that?” Melissa asked, peering over with curiosity.

She was in the bloom of youth. Though underfed—her face slightly gaunt, her complexion pale—her skin still glowed with vitality, radiating the freshness of girlhood.

Meeting her inquisitive hazel eyes, Zhou Mingrui forced calm. He grabbed the nearest object to mask his fumbling, smoothly shut the drawer, and hid the gun. In his hand was a silver-white pocket watch, its surface etched with vine-and-leaf motifs.

It was the most valuable item left by their late father, the Royal Army sergeant—but as a secondhand heirloom, it had grown increasingly unreliable. Even after repeated repairs by clockmakers, it kept malfunctioning, embarrassing Benson—who’d worn it to project status—so badly that he’d finally abandoned it at home.

Melissa, however, seemed genuinely gifted with mechanics. After learning theory at technical school, she’d begun tinkering with the watch using school tools—and recently declared she’d fixed it for good.

Zhou Mingrui popped open the watch cover. The second hand stood still. Instinctively, he twisted the crown to wind it.

But after several turns—no tightening click. The second hand remained frozen.

“It seems broken again,” he said lamely, glancing at his sister.

Melissa gave him a flat look, strode over, and snatched the watch.

Without a word, she pulled up the crown—not to set the time, but to wind it. After just a few turns, *tick-tick-tick*—the second hand sprang to life.

*Wait… shouldn’t pulling the crown adjust the time?* Zhou Mingrui’s expression went slack with confusion.

Just then, the distant cathedral bell tolled—*bong… bong… bong…*—six resonant, ethereal chimes.

Melissa listened carefully, then pulled the crown up a notch further and twisted it rapidly, perfectly syncing the hands.

“Fixed,” she stated curtly, pushed the crown back down, and handed the watch to Zhou Mingrui.

He offered an awkward but polite smile in return.

Melissa studied him a moment longer—then turned toward the cabinet, gathered her toothbrush and towel, and left for the communal washroom.

*Did she just look at me like I’m a hopeless idiot?*  
*The “poor dear brother” gaze?*

Zhou Mingrui chuckled softly, clicking the watch open and shut—*snap, click, snap, click*—lost in thought.

Without a silencer, Klein’s suicide—if it *was* suicide—must have made a tremendous noise. Yet Melissa, just one wall away, had apparently heard nothing.

Had she slept that deeply?  
Or was the entire act… unnatural?

*Click. Snap. Click. Snap.*  
When Melissa returned from washing up, that’s exactly what she saw: her brother mindlessly flipping the watch cover open and closed.

Her eyes softened with exasperated fondness. In a sweet voice, she said:

“Klein, take out the rest of the bread. Remember to buy fresh today—bread, lamb, and peas. Your interview’s coming up. I’ll make you pea stew with lamb.”

As she spoke, she dragged the stove from the corner, reignited it with leftover coals, and set a kettle to boil.

Just before the water boiled, she opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet and—like it was treasure—pulled out a tin of low-grade tea leaves. She sprinkled in about ten leaves, pretending it was proper tea.

She poured two large cups, and the siblings shared two slices of rye bread with their ersatz tea.

No sawdust mixed in, not too much bran—yet still barely edible. Zhou Mingrui, weak and hungry, swallowed it down with the bitter brew, inwardly grumbling all the while.

A few minutes later, Melissa finished eating. She gathered her long black hair, tied it back, and looked at Zhou Mingrui.

“Remember: only eight pounds of bread. It’s hot—the rest will spoil. And lamb, peas—don’t forget!”

*Yep. Definitely the “concerned little sister taking care of her bookish brother” routine—needs to repeat it twice…* He smiled and nodded. “Got it.”

From Klein’s embodied memory and his own comparison, Zhou Mingrui estimated the Loen “pound” was roughly equivalent to half a kilogram—about the weight of a traditional Chinese *jin*.

Melissa said no more. She packed the last slice of bread for lunch, donned her mother’s worn纱hat, picked up her self-sewn satchel of books and stationery, and prepared to leave.

It wasn’t Sunday—she had a full day of classes.

Walking from their apartment to Tingen Technical School took about fifty minutes. Public carriages charged one penny per kilometer—capped at 4 pennies within the city, 6 in the suburbs. To save money, Melissa always left early and walked.

Just as she opened the front door, she paused, half-turned.

“Klein—don’t buy too much lamb or peas. Benson might not be back until Sunday. And remember—only eight pounds of bread.”

“All right, all right,” Zhou Mingrui sighed in mock exasperation.

At the same time, he silently repeated the word “Sunday” in his mind.

Here in the Northern Continent, the calendar mirrored Earth’s: twelve months, 365–366 days a year, and a seven-day week.

The former suggested astronomy had developed similarly—fueling his suspicion this was a parallel world. The latter stemmed from religion: the Northern Continent officially worshiped seven deities—the Ever-Burning Sun, Lord of Storms, God of Knowledge and Wisdom, Goddess of the Night, Mother Earth, God of War, and God of Steam and Machinery.

Watching his sister close the door behind her, Zhou Mingrui let out a quiet sigh—and quickly redirected his thoughts to the luck-changing ritual.

*Sorry… I really do want to go home…*

*P.S.: It’s Monday—please give me your recommendation votes!*
